/*Jason, Samantha, Ravi, Sheila, and Ankit are preparing for an upcoming marathon. Each day of the week, they run a certain number of miles 
and write them into a notebook. At the end of the week, they would like to know the number of miles run each day, the total miles for the week,
and average miles run each day. Write a program to help them analyze their data. Your program must contain parallel arrays: an array to store 
the names of the runners and a two-dimensional array of five rows and seven columns to store the number of miles run by each runner each day. 
Furthermore, your program must contain at least the following functions: a function to read and store the runnersâ€™ names and the numbers of 
miles run each day; a function to find the total miles run by each runner and the average number of miles run each day, and a function to 
output the results. 
(You may assume that the input data is stored in a file and each line of data is in the following form: 
runnerName milesDay1 milesDay2 milesDay3 milesDay4 milesDay5 milesDay6 milesDay7.) */

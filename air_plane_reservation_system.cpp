/* Write a program that can be used to assign seats for a commercial airplane. The airplane has 13 rows, with six seats in each row. Rows 1 
and 2 are first class, rows 3 through 7 are business class, and rows 8 through 13 are economy class. Your program must prompt the user to 
enter the following information:
a. Ticket type (first class, business class, or economy class)
b. Desired seat
Output the seating plan in the following form:
        A   B   C   D   E   F
Row 1   *   *   X   *   X   X
Row 2   *   X   *   X   *   X
Row 3   *   *   X   X   *   X
Row 4   X   *   X   *   X   X
Row 5   *   X   *   X   *   *
Row 6   *   X   *   *   *   X
Row 7   X   *   *   *   X   X
Row 8   *   X   *   X   X   *
Row 9   X   *   X   X   *   X  
Row 10  *   X   *   X   X   X
Row 11  *   *   X   *   X   *
Row 12  *   *   X   X   *   X
Row 13  *   *   *   *   X   *
Here, * indicates that the seat is available; X indicates that the seat is occupied. Make this a menu-driven program; show the userâ€™s choices 
and allow the user to make the appropriate choices. */
